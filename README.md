# To declare a variable, you have to put the “&” sign first.  When you put the “=” sign, it will set the variable to the value that you want. Remember to put “;” at the end to make sure it sets.  
# For you to test if you can use an underline in your variables and set the value using an equal sign, you can try:
# &an_an = 100;
# an_an + an_ an = 100
# If you would like to test if a defined constant works such as pi, you can try this:
# &an_an = 100;
# pi * an_an =
# If you would like to test if you can add a notation to let the programmer express that, try this.
# &an_an = 100;
# const pi = 3.14
# an_an + pi =
